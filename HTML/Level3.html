    <!-- Page Layout techniques:Using Semantic tags for layout
    Semantic tags: like header, footer which work know by his name
    Non semantic tags: like dev or spain etc which name not explain functionality
    Semantic tags help to understand and good user interface and also easy to understand
    Using right tags for right things
    Semantic tags: <header>, <main>, <footer>
    inside the body we use <header> tag
    <main> use for main content
    <footer> use for contact etc information
        main tag: inside main tag -> Section tag, article tag and aside tag
        section: use for section: divide page in section
        article: we write article in it <articles>
        Aside tag: for content aside main content(ads) <aside> which is not the part of main content
            Anchor tag: use to link other page or link of web 
            but anchor tag we use target attribute which target a specific page
            image tag : attribute of height and width 
            Div tag: Dive is the container used for other html elements they have no specific work its a container for other elements
            its called non semantic tag its a block element
            its block all the width of page if you write small or large sentence its take 
            whole width its use  when highly collective element should be differentiate from each other and arange side by side.
            footer article they also take full length
            Span Tag: Span is also a container for other Html elements inline Elements which take width as per size. Inline Elements take size per width of the text size
